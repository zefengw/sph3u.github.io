        <p><b>Energy</b> is the quantitative property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on, or to heat, the object. It can only be conserved and can't be created or destroyed. This was discovered and formulated by <b>Julius Robert von Mayer, James Prescott Joule, and Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz</b> between the years 1842 and 1847. </p>

        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Energy: measurable(measured in Joules) and quantifiable change in the universe. Since everything is moving(at a constant rate), everything has energy. It means to transfer energy from one object to another by moving it more/differently and it is sometimes referred to as the ability to do "Work". Energy is measured in the force applied in a certain distance(E=F*d).</li>
            <li>Positive Work: the force being applied is in the same direction as the object's movement. </li>
            For instance, a box that is being pushed forward is also heading in the forward direction.
            <li>Negative Work: the force applied is in the opposite direction as the object's movement.</li>
            For instance, throwing a ball in the air. The period when you throw the ball in the air, the ball is travelling in the upwards direction but the force that is exerted on the object is an opposite force of gravity. 
            <li>Zero Work: the force acts perpendicular to the direction of the motion.</li>
            For instance, when you are carrying a heavy bucket in your hands and are walking a certain distance. The force applied to that bucket is opposing gravity(upwards) but there is no displacement of the bucket, so the work done by you is zero.

            <h1>Forms of Energy</h1>
        <p>
          Energy is branched into two types of energy: Kinetic Energy — energy of movement, and Potential Energy — Stored Energy. Kinetic energies include Thermal(energy of moving particles), Mechanical(energy of objects in motion), Electrical(energy of particles moving through a wire), Magnetic(energy causing a force), and Radiant Energy(energy that can travel through space, i.e. Light).
          Potential Energies include Chemical(energy stored in food or fuel), Elastic(energy stored in stretched objects), Nuclear(energy stored within particles), Gravitational(energy of gravity stored in objects above the Earth's surface), and Radiant(controversial).<br>
          To observe and apply Kinetic Energy at a certain point, it is important to ask if the object is moving(so does it have velocity). If yes, then kinetic energy is active and vice versa. The formula for calculating the kinetic energy is derived from the energy formula as well as one of the kinematic formulas: 
          <br><img class="img-fluid" src="img/post-sample-image - 副本 (13).jpg">
          <span class="caption text-muted"></span>
          To observe and apply Potential Energy at a certain point, it is important to ask if the object can fall(is the object above the ground). If yes, then potential energy is active and vice versa. The formula for calculating the potential energy is derived as follows:
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post-sample-image - 副本 (14).jpg">
          <span class="caption text-muted"></span>
        </p>
        <h1>The Law of Conservation</h1>
        <p>
          The Law of Conservation of energy is a law that states the total energy(Energy Total = Kinetic Energy + Potential Energy) is always the same before and after a period because energy is conserved and is transferred from object to object. Because of this, we are given a new way to solve physics problems namely the "rollar coaster problem":
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post-sample-image - 副本 (15).jpg">
          <span class="caption text-muted"></span>
        </p>  
        <h2>Efficiency</h2>
        <p>
          Efficiency is the percentage of useful energy outputed by an object. <br>
          Let's say that a candle uses a total of 100J of energy and 30J of it is light energy. If we are seeking light energy, then the 30J of energy would be the "useful" energy and we can solve its efficiency by solving the ratio between the useful and the total amount of energy the candle uses:<br>
          Efficiency = (30J/100J) * 100  = 0.3 * 100 = 30% <br>
          So the candle has a efficiency of 30%(which isn't that high).
        </p>
        <h2>Power</h2>
        <p>
          Power(measured in Watts) is the ratio between the amount of work(energy) done per a certain unit of time(P=E/t). It is used to calculate how quickly the energy is being transferred. 
          <br>If I apply a net force of 150N to move a box 5m and I do it in 7s, then my power would be:
          <br> P=E/t 
          <br>  =F*d/t
          <br>      =150N*5m/7s
            <br>  =107.1W
