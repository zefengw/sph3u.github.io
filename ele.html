        <h1>Electron Configuration</h1>
        <p>
          Electron Configuration is the distribution of electrons of an atom or molecule in atomic or molecular orbitals. When configuring a element, the coefficient represents the shell number(starting from the inner shells) and the exponents on the variable represents the number of electrons in that sub-shell. The variables represent their designated section on the periodic table. They are s, p, d, f, they hold 2 electrons(1 Orbital), 6 electrons(3 Orbitals), 10 electrons(5 Orbitals), and 14 electrons(7 Orbitals) respectively. <br>
          To determine the configuration of an atom with multiple electrons, we follow the Aufbau Principle, which is a rule that states that electrons fill atomic orbitals of the lowest available energy levels before occupying the higher levels.

          <span class="caption text-muted">Electron Configuration of Iron(Fe)</span>
        If the elctrons are unpaired, then there is magnetism. The arrows represent the direction the electrons spin(up arrows are spinning the same way), and a pair of electrons spin in different directions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each orbital can only hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins. If an orbital has 2 electrons, the electrons start filling in other higher-energy orbitals. Keep in mind if an atom is magnetic, that doesn't mean that the whole element is magnetic.<br>
          <br> According to Hund's Rule, every orbital in a subshell gets one electron before any orbitals get two electrons and those single electrons will have the same spin. <br>
          For instance, Nitrogen will have 3 individual arrows pointing in the same direction rather than have a pair of electrons in the p subshell; this element is paramagnetic(has any unpaired electrons) meaning it is weakly attracted to external applied magnetic fields.

          There is also a shortcut to finding the electron configuration of an element: you group all of the blocks and list the subshells in order and cross a diagonal arrow through them to indicate the order you go in, then count and solve the for the electron configuration. The answer can also be written in a short form where the previous noble gas on the periodic table is in place for some of the subshells and then list the remaining ones:

        <h1>Electromagnetic Induction</h1>
        <p>
          When electrons move, it creates a magnetic field and becomes a temporary magnet; this is an electromagnet. If the current used to create the electromagnet is DC, then it will have a fixed magnetic flux density and a fixed orientation of poles. Whereas if you use AC, it will have a varying magnetic flux density and alternating poles. The strength of an electromagnet can easily be changed by changing the amount of electric current that flows through it. <br>
          To generate electricity, you have to spin a magnet near a coil to attract/repel the electrons to create a current to then produce electricity. Hydro, Wind, Nuclear, and many more find efficient ways to make a magnet spin to produce energy.<br>
          <img style="margin-left: 250px" src="https://www.e-education.psu.edu/egee401/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.egee401/files/image/lesson06/Generator.jpg" class="img-fluid">
          <span class="caption text-muted">Magnets inside Generator of a Power Plant</span>
          Electric Currents are produced in wire loops when there is any change in the magnetic flux passing through the wire loop; this current is known as induced current. If either object moves, current is produced. Whereas, if both objects are stationary, there is no current in the wire. 
          <br>As magnetic flux increases, the current travels clockwise in the wire. As magnetic flux decreases, current travels counterclockwise in the wire. To describe the electric field induced by a moving magnet, we can use a left-hand rule, where the thumb represents the direction of the magnet's motion and the fingers represent the electric field(forces on the positive charges).
          <h2>Faraday's Law</h2>
          <p>
            Faraday's Law states that the induced voltage is equal to the negative change in magnetic flux over a unit of time. There is a negative sign because the Electromagnetic Force(induced voltage) always opposes any change in the magnetic flux; this is Lenz's Law.

        <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
        <p>
          When you snap a magnet in half, nothing about the magnetic field really changes. The two halves will attract each other's broken ends and will be able to stick back together again. A big magnet is made of many tiny magnets(with north and south poles) called magnetic domains. So if you cut a magnet in half, the newly cut faces will become the new north or south poles of the smaller pieces.
